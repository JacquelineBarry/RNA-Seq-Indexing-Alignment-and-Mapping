# RNA-Seq-Indexing-Alignment-and-Mapping
This script indexes reference genomes, aligns RNA-Seq data and maps them to the genomes using Hi-Sat2. The result generates numerous summary statistics, some of which include the number of reads, alignments, and estimated mapping coverage using Samtools and the flagstat option.
